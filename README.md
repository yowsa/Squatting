# Squatting

Squatting is a Flutter mobile app that tracks your daily time sitting in a resting squat position. Resting in a squat position each day can help increase mobility in your hips, ankles and back. The app includes instructions on how to properly sit relaxed in a squat position, as well as some useful tools if youâ€™re having trouble.

Time is tracked by either using the built in timer or by submitting time through the time picker, each submitted time section is then summed up to a daily total. In the history view you can look back to each day to see how many minutes you sat in a squat position that day.
